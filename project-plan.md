# Hundreds Workout Tracking App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A mobile-optimized web application for tracking daily workouts consisting of:
- 100 pushups
- 100 situps  
- 100 squats
- 5 mile run

The app will track partial progress throughout the day, reset at midnight, and store historical data in a calendar view for review.

## Implementation Todo List

### Development Tasks
- [x] Design app architecture and data structure
- [ ] Create responsive HTML structure for mobile-first design
- [ ] Build CSS styling with mobile optimization
- [ ] Implement daily workout tracking interface with counters
- [ ] Create local storage system for data persistence
- [ ] Build calendar view with compact daily summaries
- [ ] Implement detailed day view modal/popup
- [ ] Add midnight reset functionality with timezone handling
- [ ] Create data export/import functionality for backup
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages deployment configuration
- [ ] Test on mobile devices and optimize UX
- [ ] Create documentation and setup instructions

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Tracking Interface
- 4 exercise counters: Pushups (0/100), Situps (0/100), Squats (0/100), Running (0.0/5.0 miles)
- Each counter has: text input field, +/- buttons, current/target display
- Progress bars or visual indicators for completion status

### 2. Calendar View
- Monthly calendar grid
- Each day shows 3 stacked numbers: pushups/situps/squats completed
- Running miles shown as decimal (e.g., "5.0" or "3.2")
- Color coding: green for complete, yellow for partial, gray for no activity
- Click/tap day for detailed view

### 3. Data Management
- Browser localStorage for device-local persistence
- JSON structure: `{ "2025-01-15": { pushups: 85, situps: 100, squats: 75, running: 4.2 } }`
- Automatic midnight reset (user's timezone)
- Export/import functionality for backup

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (no frameworks for simplicity)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features for mobile experience
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  currentDate: "2025-01-15",
  dailyTargets: { pushups: 100, situps: 100, squats: 100, running: 5.0 },
  workoutHistory: {
    "2025-01-15": { pushups: 25, situps: 50, squats: 30, running: 1.5, timestamp: "..." },
    "2025-01-14": { pushups: 100, situps: 100, squats: 100, running: 5.0, timestamp: "..." }
  }
}
```

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html          # Main app interface
├── styles.css          # Mobile-optimized styling
├── script.js           # Core application logic
├── manifest.json       # PWA configuration
├── service-worker.js   # Offline functionality
└── README.md          # Setup and usage instructions
```

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44px tap targets)
- Viewport meta tag for proper mobile scaling
- Swipe gestures for calendar navigation
- Large, readable fonts and high contrast

### 2. Data Persistence Strategy
- Primary: localStorage (survives browser restarts)
- Backup: JSON export/import feature
- Future: Could add cloud sync when you get your Mac

### 3. Midnight Reset Logic
- Check current date vs stored date on app load
- If different day, save yesterday's progress and reset counters
- Handle timezone changes and daylight saving time

### 4. Deployment Options
- GitHub Pages (free, easy setup)
- Your custom domain (can point to GitHub Pages)
- Works offline once loaded (PWA features)

## User Experience Flow

### Daily Use
1. Open app → see today's progress
2. Tap +/- or type numbers to update counters
3. Visual feedback shows progress toward goals
4. App saves automatically

### Historical Review
1. Tap calendar icon → see monthly view
2. Quick scan of daily numbers in grid
3. Tap specific day → detailed popup with exact numbers
4. Navigate between months with arrows

### Data Management
1. Settings menu for export/import
2. Reset functionality if needed
3. Target adjustment (future feature)

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- localStorage support required
- Touch event support for mobile interaction

### Performance Considerations
- Lightweight codebase for fast loading
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Offline functionality via service worker

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Streak tracking and achievements
- Weekly/monthly progress charts
- Custom workout targets
- Social sharing features
- Apple Health / Google Fit integration
- Native iOS app conversion

This architecture provides a solid foundation that's simple to implement, works great on mobile, stores data locally on your device, and can easily be hosted on GitHub Pages or your domain. The PWA features will make it feel almost like a native app when accessed from your phone's home screen.
